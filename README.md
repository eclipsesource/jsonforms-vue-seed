# JSON Forms Vue Seed

This seed demonstrates how to use [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io) with Vue in order to render a simple form for displaying a task entity.

You can find the [Vue 2 seed on the `vue2` branch](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed/tree/vue2).
**_NOTE:_**  Vue 2 is only suported until JSON Forms 3.1.0.

It is based on the `vue create` Hello World project.

`src/App.vue` contains the JSON Forms specific code.


- Sync your used node version with one in `.nvmrc`
  (e.g. `nvm install && nvm use` from this repo's root, if you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
- Execute `npm ci` to install the prerequisites.
- Execute `npm run dev` to start the application.

Browse to http://localhost:5173 to see the application in action.

For more information please see the JSON Forms Vue [documentation](https://jsonforms.io/docs/integrations/vue).
